Five ways you can hire better:

Know why you’re hiring (what problems do you need to solve?)
Write a good job posting
Seek out diversity
Train the team on how to interview
Start the relationship on the right foot

Job posting do’s and don’ts:
+ Do describe details of this role
+ Do use more general requirements than specific ones
+ Do use inclusive language
- Don’t copy/paste from earlier posting
- Don’t use a kitchen sink approach for requirements
- Don’t use education as a shortcut for experience
